This directory includes two simple tests of the
security provided by ReCFI.


TwoIDTest: Demonstrates that Two-Class CFI 
detects attempts to hijack the return address to
point to an address that's not a return site, in
this case the beginning of a function.

    >cd TwoIDTest
    >./build.sh vulnerable two
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_vuln correct!
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_vuln `python -c "print('a'*22 + '1482'.decode('hex'))"`
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_fixed `python -c "print('a'*22 + '1482'.decode('hex'))"`
    >qemu-arm vulnerable-fixed 


MultiIDTest: Demonstrates that Two-Class CFI
does not detect attempts to hijack a function
pointer to point to another function which should
not happen in real program behavior. Also 
demonstrates how Multi-Class CFI is a stronger
policy than Two-Class CFI by detecting this.

    >cd MultiIDTest
    >./build.sh vulnerable two
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_vuln Billy name
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_vuln `python -c "print('a'*14 + '1482'.decode('hex'))"` name
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_fixed `python -c "print('a'*14 + '1482'.decode('hex'))"` name
    >./build.sh vulnerable merge
    >qemu-arm vulnerable_fixed `python -c "print('a'*14 + '1482'.decode('hex'))"` name
