DSA is changed since PLDI07 in (at least) the following ways:

1) DSA tracks types per offset.
2) DSA does not assume that all clients will want to collapse a node if types 
   conflict.  Many clients don't care that an offset is used as an int or a 
   double, they just care about the points-to result.

In Progress:

1) DSA handles multiple entry points in a module.
2) Optional assumption that only legal targets are called at indirect call sites
3) Positional arguments, rather than pointer relative arguments.  This handles
   the case where pointer and ints are assumed compatible and function pointers
   containing them are cast freely.
