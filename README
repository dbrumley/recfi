ReCFI Installation Guide
================================

ReCFI is a re-targetable, tunable CFI framework implemented 
using the LLVM compiler toolchain. This project was funded by
Boeing and was created at CMU by Joseph Battaglia and Oulin 
Yao with the advise of Professor David Brumley. The ReCFI 
prototype was built and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, using 
LLVM 3.3. This prototype targets ARM.

All bash commands below begin with ">" and should be typed
as a single line.


1. Install Dependencies
================================

    Install ARM related dependencies:

        >apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
        >apt-get install qemu qemu-user

    You can also install qemu-system if you want to do 
    system-emulation. Because we will be linking LLVM bitcode 
    files, we need to change the default ARM linker to one 
    that accepts plugins. Save a copy of the default linker 
    and switch to ld.gold.

        >cd /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/bin
        >mov ld ld.old
        >mov ld.gold ld

    For debugging purposes:

        >apt-get install gdb-multiarch

2. Build LLVM-3.3
=================================

    Download and build LLVM gold plugin by following the
    directions under the "How To Build It" section at this
    link:

    http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/docs/GoldPlugin.html

    Get LLVM-3.3 and ReCFI source:
        
        >git clone http://URL (TODO after move)

    Create build directory for LLVM-3.3 to keep source clean,
    then configure the build directory.

        >cd /path/to/recfi
        >mkdir build
        >cd build
        >../llvm-3.3/configure --enable-debug-symbols --enable-runtime-symbols --with-llvmsrc=/path/to/recfi/llvm-3.3 --with-llvmobj=/path/to/recfi/build --with-binutils-include=/path/to/binutils/src/include

    Configure poolalloc (contains DSA libraries):

        >cd /path/to/recfi/build/project/poolalloc
        >../../../llvm-3.3/project/poolalloc/configure --enable-debug-symbols --enable-runtime-symbols --with-llvmsrc=/path/to/recfi/llvm-3.3 --with-llvmobj=/path/to/recfi/build

    Build LLVM-3.3. LLVM can be built concurrently using the
    -j <n> option with make, e.g. "make -j 4". 

        >cd /path/to/recfi/build
        >make -j 4
        >export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/recfi/build/Release+Debug+Asserts/bin

3. Build ReCFI
=================================

    Generate configuration file (may be asked to provide 
    paths to llvm-3.3 source and build directories).

        >cd /path/to/recfi/cfi-analysis
        >cd autoconf
        >./AutoRegen.sh

    Create a build directory in cfi-analysis and configure.

        >cd ..
        >mkdir build
        >cd build
        >../configure --enable-debug-symbols --enable-runtime-symbols --with-llvmsrc=/path/to/recfi/llvm-3.3 --with-llvmobj=/path/to/recfi/build

    Change absolute paths in Makefiles in the lib directory.
    Unfortunately, using relative paths in these Makefiles
    failed to compile.

        >cd /path/to/recfi/cfi-analysis/lib
        
    For every sub-directory in lib, modify the Makefile in 
    the sub-directory such that LLVMSRC has the correct
    path. Now you can build cfi-analysis.

        >cd /path/to/recfi/cfi-analysis/build
        >make

4. Running ReCFI on Coreutils
=================================

    Download coreutils 8.22 (can use wget):

    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/

    Create and configure build directory:

        >cd /path/to/coreutils
        >mkdir build
        >cd build
        >../configure --disable-nls CFLAGS="-g -static -I /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include/ -Wno-unknown-warning-option" LDFLAGS="-L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/lib -L /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabi" CC=clang

    Make sure that recfi-ar has the correct absolute path
    to LLVMgold.so, which should be here:

    /path/to/recfi/build/Release+Debug+Asserts/lib/LLVMgold.so

        >cd /path/to/recfi/scripts
        >vim recfi-ar

    Build Coreutils. Note that Coreutils versions that 
    generate man-pages (including 8.22) will fail towards 
    the end of the build, but the binaries should still be 
    correct. Binaries will be in coreutils/build/src, and 
    there should be a LLVM bit-code file (.bc) generated 
    for each binary.

        >make CC=/path/to/recfi/scripts/recfi-gcc AR=/path/to/recfi/scripts/recfi-ar RANLIB=/bin/true

    Instrument Coreutils with ReCFI, where <cfi policy>
    is "two", "merge", or "list"

        >cd /path/to/coreutils/build/
        >/path/to/recfi/scripts/opt-script src <cfi policy>

    Run Coreutils tools:
  
        >cd /path/to/coreutils/build/src
        >qemu-arm ./<tool> [options]

    There is a known issue with running Coreutils tools
    hardened using ReCFI. Because we did not recompile system 
    libraries when hardening coreutils, they remain unhardened 
    and are linked during assembling. This will cause a 
    problem if an unhardened library function calls a hardened 
    Coreutil function, since the hardened function will check 
    for a return target ID, which will not exist in the 
    unhardened library function. This causes the checking code 
    to abort. Specifically, this happens when the exit function 
    is invoked, which will call __run_exit_handlers, which will 
    then call a hardened coreutil function via function pointer. 
    This problem will be mitigated if system libraries are 
    compiled to LLVM IR and linked at IR stage rather than 
    assembly stage.
